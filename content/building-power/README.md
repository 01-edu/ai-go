#### star-forge

The goal of this exercise is to teach you how to effectively use AI tools to
enhance your learning experience. You will learn how to "Speak AI" by crafting
precise prompts that generate useful responses. This process will help you
understand complex concepts better through examples, like metaphors, while
collaborating with your peers.

#### declare-everything

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand how to declare variables in
JavaScript using the `let` keyword. You will learn to assign meaningful
identifiers to values, which will make your code clearer and more organized. By
creating variables like `seven` and `seventySeven`, you will practice using
strings as values and reinforce the concept of linking identifiers with their
respective values. This foundational skill is crucial for programming.

#### play-with-variables

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand how to work with variables
and escape characters in JavaScript. You will practice creating variables that
include special characters like quotes and backslashes. Additionally, you will
learn to reassign a variable's value without redeclaring it. This will enhance
your coding skills and problem-solving abilities in JavaScript.

#### the-smooth-operator

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand and practice using math
operators and template literals in JavaScript. You will work with basic
arithmetic operations, learn how to declare and manipulate variables, and create
strings that incorporate variable values through placeholders. This will enhance
your coding skills and confidence in JavaScript.

#### objects-around

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand JavaScript objects by
creating and manipulating them. You will learn how to group related properties,
such as name, age, and energy status, into an object. This will improve your
ability to manage data in your programs. You will also practice accessing and
using these properties effectively.

#### transform-objects

The goal of this exercise is to teach you how to work with JavaScript objects by
modifying, adding, and removing properties. You will create a robot object and
enhance its features, such as adding a name and adjusting its points.
Additionally, you will explore string manipulation by duplicating a sentence,
building your skills in both object handling and string operations, allowing you
to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

#### listed

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand and work with arrays in
JavaScript. You will learn how to create arrays, access their elements, modify
values, and use properties like `.length`. Through tasks, you will practice
declaring arrays, accessing and manipulating their elements, and replacing
values. This will build your skills in handling lists of items effectively,
which is crucial for programming.

#### good-recipe

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand and practice using
JavaScript methods. You will work with robot objects, string manipulation, and
mathematical functions. By completing tasks, you will gain hands-on experience
in using methods like `Math.max`, `.slice`, and text transformation methods.
This practice will build your confidence in coding.

#### only-if

The goal of this exercise is to help you understand how to use conditions in
JavaScript to control robot actions based on different situations. You will
learn about truthy and falsy values, logical operators, and how to implement if,
else if, and else statements. By solving the tasks, you will strengthen your
programming skills and gain practical experience in writing conditional code.

#### first-function

The goal of this exercise is to teach you how to declare and call functions in
JavaScript. You will create custom functions that allow your robot to perform
specific tasks, such as logging messages to the console. You will practice by
declaring functions named `ask` and `reply`, then calling them to see the
output, reinforcing your understanding of function syntax and behavior.

#### i-win-arguments

The goal of this exercise is to master using arguments in functions within
JavaScript. You will learn to create functions that accept one or multiple
arguments, manipulate these arguments, and return values. This knowledge is
essential for making your robot fully functional, enhancing its capabilities.
You will complete tasks that involve defining functions, formatting output, and
using argument values effectively.

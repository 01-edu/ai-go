# Motion Magic

Welcome to the `Motion Magic` Quest!

You've completed the previous challenges and gained all the knowledge power you need to bring your robot to life. Now, you’re stepping into the realm of motion control—where creativity meets code. Imagine yourself as a master creator, not just a coder but a true innovator, like Tony Stark when he first brings Iron Man to life. Except, in this quest, your tools are `JavaScript` and your ally is `AI`.

This is the third quest in your journey, where you will unlock the first small motions for your robot. But this isn't just about writing code—it's about thinking, creating, and designing with a new mindset.

### Challenge mode

> JSPowered Mode: In this mode, you already have enough tools to conquer any challenge by leveraging your ability to search, collaborate with peers, and use AI as a guide. Remember, peer collaboration will play the biggest role in your success.

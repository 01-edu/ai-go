# Motion Magic

Welcome to the `Motion Magic` Quest!

You've completed the previous challenges and gained all the knowledge power you need to bring your robot to life. Now, you’re stepping into the realm of motion control—where creativity meets code. Imagine yourself as a master creator, not just a coder but a true innovator, like Tony Stark when he first brings Iron Man to life. Except, in this quest, your tools are `JavaScript` and your ally is `AI`.

This is the third quest in your journey, where you will unlock the first small motions for your robot. But this isn't just about writing code—it's about thinking, creating, and designing with a new mindset.

### Challenge mode

> JSPowered Mode: In this mode, you already have enough tools to conquer any challenge by leveraging your ability to search, collaborate with peers, and use AI as a guide. Remember, peer collaboration will play the biggest role in your success.

### Overview

- You will learn how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript by selecting
  elements by their ID.
- You will gain experience in adding event listeners to buttons, making your
  code respond to user actions.
- You will practice changing text content in the HTML dynamically through
  JavaScript.
- You will understand how to modify styles with CSS, enhancing the visual appeal
  of your project.
- You will learn to manage the display of elements, checking their state and
  updating them as needed.
- You will explore Random Color Generation to dynamically change the appearance
  of elements.
- You will develop your problem-solving skills by planning your code before
  starting to write it.
- You will strengthen your knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) and
  event handling in web development.

#### first-wink

The goal of this exercise is to use your JavaScript knowledge to make a robot
"wink" by creating a button that toggles the left eye's state. You will
manipulate HTML and CSS, selecting an element by its ID, adding event listeners,
changing text, and modifying styles based on the eye's status. Begin with a plan
and utilize resources as needed to guide your coding process.

#### first-hello

The goal of this exercise is to enable your robot to say "Hello World" when you
click a button. You will add a new button to the HTML, style it with CSS, and
write JavaScript to manage the text display. When the button is clicked, it will
check if the text is already shown; if so, it will remove it, otherwise, it will
create and show the text in the robot's torso. This helps you practice HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

#### colorful-arms

The goal of this exercise is to teach you how to enhance your robot's appearance
by adding a button that changes its arm colors. You will create a button in the
HTML, style it with CSS, and use JavaScript to apply a random color to the arms
each time the button is clicked. This exercise helps you understand DOM
manipulation and event handling.

#### colorful-legs

In this exercise, you will enhance the robot by changing the color of its legs
using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will create a button in the top right
corner that, when clicked, will change the background color of both legs. This
builds on your previous work and helps you practice manipulating element styles
dynamically. Stay focused and ask for help if needed!
